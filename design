Demo Scenario
- Have a business named WW.
- Customers of Business WW buy something and pay via stripe.
- Import transactions from Stripe into web app.
- Review imported transactions. Maybe edit them.
- Push transactions from web app to QBO

Web App Design
1. Connect with QBO button -> allows users (eg. owner of WW) to login to their intuit account and connect their qbo company to web app.
2. Connect with Stripe button -> allows users (eg. owner of WW) to login to their stripe account and connect their stripe account to web app.
3. Pull transactions from connected stripe account and display in a table
4. Each row is a separate stripe transaction. Each row will have an 'Sync to QBO' button.
5. The 'Sync to QBO' button will push the corresponding transaction to QBO by creating a sales receipt in QBO.
6. If the transaction has already been synced with QBO the 'Sync to QBO' button should be disabled/not shown.

Future Ideas
1. Combine multiple stripe transactions into one Intuit transaction.
2. Transfer customer data from Stripe to QBO to derive customer related insights.
3. Transfer location data from Stripe to QBO to derive location based insights.
4. Connect to multiple stripe accounts and/or QBO companies. Data from multiple stripe accounts going to same QBO account.

Other Things to Consider - TODO
1. Unit tests / Functional Tests - 
2. Fault tolerance - what happens when sync fails.
3. Considerations for deploy on cloud.
4. Scalability of the web app.
