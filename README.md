Intuit + Stripe OAuth2.0 Craft Demo Problem - NodeJS
==========================================================

## Overview

This is a POC app built using Node.js and Express Framework to showcase Intuit + Stripe integration. 
The app allows users to connect to their Intuit QuickBooks Company account using [Intuit's OAuth2.0 Client library](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbpayments/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0).
Users can connect to their Stripe Account using [Stripe's OAuth connect flow](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/oauth-reference).
After connecting the two accounts users can import sales transactions from Stripe, review them in the Web App, and export to Intuit's QBO as Sales Receipts. The app also recognizes charges that are already synced to prevent exporting duplicate transactions. 

## Installation

### Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) >= 7.0.0
* [Intuit Developer](https://developer.intuit.com) Account
* [Stripe Developer](https://stripe.com/docs/development) Account

### Via Github Repo (Recommended)

```bash
$ cd sample
$ npm install
```

## Configuration

Copy the contents from `.env.example` to `.env` within the sample directory:
```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file to add your:  


* **PORT:(optional)** Optional port number for the app to be served
* **NGROK_ENABLED:(optional)** By default it is set to `false`. If you want to serve the Sample App over HTTPS ( which is mandatory if you want to test this app using Production Credentials), set the variable to `true`



### TLS / SSL (**optional**)

If you want your enpoint to be exposed over the internet. The easiest way to do that while you are still developing your code locally is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  

You dont have to worry about installing ngrok. The sample application does that for you.   
1. Just set `NGROK_ENABLED` = `true` in `.env` 


## Usage

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Without ngrok (if you are using localhost i.e `NGROK_ENABLED`=`false` in `.env`)
You will see an URL as below:
```bash
ðŸ’³ Step 1 : Paste this URL in your browser : http://localhost:8000
ðŸ’³ Step 2 : Copy and Paste the clientId and clientSecret from : https://developer.intuit.com
ðŸ’³ Step 3 : Copy Paste this callback URL into `redirectURI` : http://localhost:8000/callback
ðŸ’» Step 4 : Make Sure this redirect URI is also listed under the Redirect URIs on your app in : https://developer.intuit.com
```

### With ngrok (if you are using ngrok i.e `NGROK_ENABLED`=`true` in `.env`)

Your will see an URL as below : 
```bash
ðŸ’³ Step 1 : Paste this URL in your browser :  https://9b4ee833.ngrok.io 
ðŸ’³ Step 2 : Copy and Paste the clientId and clientSecret from : https://developer.intuit.com
ðŸ’³ Step 3 : Copy Paste this callback URL into `redirectURI` : https://9b4ee833.ngrok.io/callback
ðŸ’» Step 4 : Make Sure this redirect URI is also listed under the Redirect URIs on your app in : https://developer.intuit.com
```

Click on the URL and follow through the instructions given in the sample app.
